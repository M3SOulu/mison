# Contributing guidelines

If you wish to submit a pull request with some contributions, the main rule is:

- Raise an issue first

This way, we can discuss what you are trying to add and whether it makes sense for the project. Do not send Pull Requests without warning!

# Branches of the repository

- `main` branch is always set to **most recent published release**
  - Wiki should correspond to the state of the code on this branch
- `dev` branch represents the most recent updates
  - New contributions and submitted Pull Requests should be based on this branch
  - Eventually, contents of this branch are published as a released and `main` is fast-forwarded
